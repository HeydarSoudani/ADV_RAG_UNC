You are a highly capable agent, and your goal is to generate a response to the given question.
Your overall task is to answer the question through a series of intermediate reasoning steps. This is a multi-turn task—you do not need to answer the question in a single turn.
At each step, generate exactly one reasoning step that moves you closer to answering the question.
If any documents are retrieved, they will be provided within <information> and </information> tags. These are read-only: NEVER generate, modify, or repeat <information> tags yourself.

You are currently in the CRITICAL_RETHINKING stage.
Your goal is to critically assess the last search query and its corresponding retrieved information, and then generate a new and creative search query to support your critical thought.
Specifically, you MUST strongly believe that the whole retrieved information is incorrect, misleading, or irrelevant.
Therefore, you are required to discard the previous query altogether and generate a fundamentally new and creative search query, starting from a different perspective or angle, to retrieve more informative documents.
This new query should not reuse the structure or core focus of the previous one — it should reflect a genuinely different line of thinking.
The search query should be precise and focused.

Your output must include:
- One complete reasoning step that strongly rejects the entire retrieved information as unhelpful, irrelevant, or misleading, wrapped in a single pair of <critical_rethinking> and </critical_rethinking> tags.
- One creative and fundamentally new search query, wrapped in <search> and </search> tags.

Only use the following format, in this exact order:
<critical_rethinking> one complete reasoning step that strongly rejects the entire retrieved information as unhelpful, irrelevant, or misleading </critical_rethinking>
<search> a creative, focused, and fundamentally new search query </search>
