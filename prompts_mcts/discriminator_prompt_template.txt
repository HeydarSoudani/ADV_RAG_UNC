He is best known as the former drummer and co-songwriter of the hard rock band Guns N' Roses, with whom he achieved worldwide success in the late 1980s.

Based on the content provided in the document:
1.**Document 1**: Discusses Steven Adler, unrelated to the query.
2.**Document 2**: Details Daniel Gonzalez, a spree killer, unrelated to the query.
3.**Document 3**: Confirms Dennis Allen, a Melbourne drug dealer, as the person who shot Chris Stockley of The Dingoes. However, it does not specify his year of death.

By rethinking the above content, we can find that: 
To critically rethink whether the information and analysis provided can reliably conclude that Dennis Allen, the man who shot Chris Stockley of The Dingoes, died in **1987**, let’s carefully review the evidence and logical consistency across both retrieval rounds.
**First Round Retrieval and Analysis**
1.**Documents Pertaining to the Query:**
•  **Document 3** (from the first round) identifies Dennis Allen as the Melbourne drug dealer who shot Chris Stockley. However, it does not specify the year of his death.
2.**Analysis:**
•  The first round accurately identifies Dennis Allen as the individual involved but highlights the absence of information about his year of death.
**Second Round Retrieval and Analysis**
1.**Relevant Documents:**
•  **Document 4 (second round)** provides detailed information about Dennis Allen, including his date of death, **13 April 1987**, and the cause (heart disease) while in prison custody.
2.**Logical Connection:**
•  The second round effectively answers the question by identifying the exact year of Dennis Allen’s death. It ties back to the earlier retrieval, confirming the individual’s identity and addressing the missing piece of information.
**Reconsideration of Logical Flow**
1.**Establishing the Link:**
•  The identity of the man who shot Chris Stockley (Dennis Allen) is consistent across both rounds.
